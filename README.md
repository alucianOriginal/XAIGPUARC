# XAIGPUARC
This is a AI Installation Tool specialised for Linux (Debian, Red Hat, Arch and Suse Family) and ARC Intel GPUs to run over SYCL.

Tested with the help of my good old friend jeyf123! 

Early Version. You need to change the AI Name in XAIGPUARC for your onw AI wish.
You need to change the Promt yourself until i build in the Chat function.

Do the AI in the /models Folder who is created in the first build to start. 


To Run the XAIGPUARC Download PREXAIGPUARC and XAIGPUARC in your /home/yourname/ Folder.

Than open your Console and make sure the Files can be build with type in:

chmod +x PREXAIGPUAR 
chmod +x XAIGPUARC

If that is done you should be able to start the PREXAIGPUARC 
./PREXAIGPUARC

The build will start every time full new until i changed that! It needs some Minutes, dependet on your Hardware.


In some cases (known from Arch Garuda Linux) , you need to Install the "intel-oneapi-basekit" manuall over your paket manager!!!
