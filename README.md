# XAIGPUARC
This is AI Installation Tool specialised for Linux (Debian, Red Hat, Arch and Suse Family) and ARC Intel GPUs to run over SYCL.

Tested with the help of my good old friend jeyf123! 

Early Version. You need to change the AI Name in XAIGPUARC for your onw AI wish.
You need to change the Promt yourself until i build in the Chat function.

Do the AI in the /models Folder who is created in the first build to start.
